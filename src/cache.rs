//! # Local Cache Management for CernVM-FS
//!
//! This module provides functionality for managing the local cache of CernVM-FS objects.
//! The cache stores downloaded repository objects to improve performance and allow
//! offline access to previously accessed content.
//!
//! ## Cache Structure
//!
//! The cache follows a two-level directory structure:
//! - The main cache directory contains a `data` subdirectory
//! - Inside `data`, objects are organized into 256 subdirectories (00-ff) based on
//!   the first two hex characters of their content hash
//!
//! ## Cache Operations
//!
//! The cache supports the following operations:
//! - Initialization: Creating the directory structure
//! - Adding: Determining the path where a file should be stored
//! - Retrieval: Looking up files by their identifier
//! - Eviction: Clearing the cache and rebuilding the structure
