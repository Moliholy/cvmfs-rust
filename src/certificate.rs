//! # Certificate Management for CernVM-FS
//!
//! This module provides certificate handling functionality for the CernVM-FS client.
//! It allows parsing, verifying and managing X509 certificates used in the repository
//! signing process. Certificates are used to verify the authenticity of repository
//! content by validating digital signatures.
//!
//! ## Certificate Handling
//!
//! CernVM-FS uses X509 certificates for repository authentication. This module
//! provides a wrapper around the `x509_certificate` crate to handle certificate
//! operations specific to CernVM-FS requirements.
