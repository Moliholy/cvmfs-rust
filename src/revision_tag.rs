//! # Revision Tag Management for CernVM-FS
//!
//! This module provides functionality for handling repository revision tags in CernVM-FS.
//! Revision tags are metadata entries that identify specific snapshots of the repository
//! content at different points in time. They allow for temporal navigation through
//! repository history.
//!
//! ## Revision Tags
//!
//! In CernVM-FS, revision tags provide the following capabilities:
//! - Named references to specific repository states (e.g., "production", "testing")
//! - Revision number tracking for sequential versioning
//! - Timestamp information for temporal navigation
//! - Channel assignment for content categorization
//! - Description text for human-readable context
//!
//! ## Tag Queries
//!
//! This module provides SQL queries for retrieving tags by different criteria:
//! - By name: Find a specific named tag
//! - By revision: Find a tag with a specific revision number
//! - By date: Find the tag active at a specific point in time
//! - All tags: List all repository tags in chronological order
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Revision tags are typically accessed through the History module:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use cvmfs::history::History;
//!
//! let history = History::new("/path/to/history.db").unwrap();
//!
//! // Get tag by name
//! if let Ok(Some(tag)) = history.get_tag_by_name("production") {
//!     println!("Production tag is at revision {}", tag.revision);
//! }
//! ```
