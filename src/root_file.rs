//! # Root File Management for CernVM-FS
//!
//! This module provides functionality for handling CernVM-FS repository root files,
//! which serve as entry points into the repository. Root files are signed files
//! containing key-value pairs that define essential repository properties.
//!
//! ## Root File Format
//!
//! Root files follow a specific format:
//! - Each line contains a key-value pair
//! - Keys are represented by a single character at the beginning of each line
//! - Values follow the key character directly
//! - The key-value section is terminated either by EOF or a termination line (--)
//! - After the termination line, a signature may follow, consisting of:
//!   * A SHA-1 hash of the key-value content
//!   * A binary private-key signature
//!
//! ## Root File Types
//!
//! The main root files in CernVM-FS are:
//! - `.cvmfspublished` (manifest): Contains repository metadata and references
//! - `.cvmfswhitelist`: Lists trusted certificates for repository validation

/// Base class for CernVM-FS repository's signed 'root files'.
///
/// A CernVM-FS repository has essential 'root files' that have a defined name and
/// serve as entry points into the repository.
/// Namely, the manifest (.cvmfspublished) and the whitelist (.cvmfswhitelist) that
/// both have class representations inheriting from RootFile and implementing the
/// abstract methods defined here.
///
/// Any 'root file' in CernVM-FS is a signed list of line-by-line key-value pairs
/// where the key is represented by a single character in the beginning of a line
/// directly followed by the value. The key-value part of the file is terminted
/// either by EOF or by a termination line (--) followed by a signature.
///
/// The signature follows directly after the termination line with a hash of the
/// key-value line content (without the termination line) followed by an \n and a
/// binary string containing the private-key signature terminated by EOF.
